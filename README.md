# Gatling Load Tests

Welcome to the repository for load testing the ShellOnYou app using the [Gatling tool](https://github.com/gatling/gatling?tab=readme-ov-file). This repository contains scripts for running load tests as well as the results from experiments conducted for the ICWS 2024 paper[1] on both the monolith and the microservice version. If you are interested in a script to load test the Monolithic version of the application, please contact us.

For detailed information, please refer to the README inside the *Load_Tests_Scripts* folder.
