This repo contains scripts for conducting load tests on the *microservice* version of ShellOnYou, using the [Gatling tool](https://github.com/gatling/gatling?tab=readme-ov-file). It also contains results obtained in experiments performed for the ICWS 2024 paper [1]. If interested by load tests on the Monolithic version of the app, please contact us.
